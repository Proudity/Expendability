a test for a g4me i'm making

So basically speaking i'm trying to make some sort of (incremental?) g4me, where one object multiplies the production of another, and whatnot.

## When will it be done?

i dunno dude ask the website

## How much will be included?

I'm planning for about 35 total objects thus far. Some of them will produce the one before it, others will multiply others, and so on.

## Who are you working with?

My team includes a mass of developers from around the world, including the famous Me, the well-known Myself, and last but not least, the consoleable yet soul-defying I.

## What can we expect?

Probably days of gameplay, different modes, themes, and some secrets. Not to mention the objects.

### Alright dudes have a good one i'll finish this sometime in 2023
